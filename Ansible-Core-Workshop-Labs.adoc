= *Lab #1. Ansible_Install*

For this lab, ansible has already been installed during the lab provisioning process.

To verify ansible is installed on your control machine (TRAINING-LAB-studentnn-ansible), ssh into the VM and type;

*ansible --version* +
*ansible --help*


Verify your ansible.cfg file looks like the following by typing cat ~/.ansible.cfg +
Example output: +
$ cat ~/.ansible.cfg
....
[defaults]
connection = smart
timeout = 60
inventory = ~instruct1/lightbulb/lessons/lab_inventory/instruct1-instances.txt
host_key_checking = False
....



= *Lab #2. Adhoc_commands*

TASK 1. Test that Ansible is setup correctly to communicate with all hosts in your inventory using the `ping` module;

[.lead]
*$ ansible all -m ping*

TASK 2. Fetch and display to STDOUT Ansible facts using the `setup` module;

[.lead]
*$ ansible all -m setup*

Example Output;
....
node-2 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "ansible_all_ipv4_addresses": [
            "10.0.1.57"
        ], 
        "ansible_default_ipv4": {

*TASK 3. Setup and enable the EPEL package repository on the hosts in the "web" group using the yum module;*

*$ ansible web -b -m yum -a "name=https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm state=present"*

NOTE: Run this the command the first time and notice the changes as identified in stdout.

*TASK 3b. Re-run the above command and notice ansible does not attempt any changes as the package has been installed. the new output from re-running the command should be similar to below;*

....

= *Lab #3. Simple_playbook (nginx)* +
This example is designed to be used as a quick introduction to playbook structure that demonstrates how Ansible works.
This playbook assures the hosts in a group called "web" has the Nginx web server present and is started with a static custom home page. The hosts are presumed to be running a Red Hat family linux.

*TASK 1.* On your control node, change to the directory; /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/simple_playbook/resources (please note you will need to specify the correct user under the home directory)

To change directories, type; +
*$ cd /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/ansible_engine/simple_playbook/resources*

Verify the index.html file is present but typing; *ls*

*TASK 2.* On your control node open an editor (such as vi) and create the following ansible playbook (be sure to start with the 3 dashes in the first line);

You may need to run your editor as sudo - i.e. sudo vi simple_playbook.yml

i.e. http://34.229.6.4

If successful, you should see a web page with the Ansible logo.



= *Lab #4. Basic_Playbook (A more practical playbook)*

Create an Ansible playbook that will assure nginx is present, configured and running on all hosts in the "web" group:

....
1. Has variables for `nginx_test_message` and `nginx_keepalive_timeout`.
2. Assures that the following yum packages are present on the each web host:
    * nginx
    * python-pip
    * python-devel
    * gcc
3. Assure that the uwsgi pip package is present on each host.
4. Generate a host-specific home page with the value of `nginx_test_message` for each host using the provided `index.html.j2` template.
5. Generate a configuration with the value of `nginx_keepalive_timeout` for each host using the provided `nginx.conf.j2` template.
6. Assure that nginx is running on each host.
7. The playbook should restart nginx if the homepage or configuration file is altered.
....

While developing the playbook use the `--syntax-check` to check your work and debug problems. 

Run your playbook in verbose mode using the `-v` switch to get more information on what Ansible is doing.

Try `-vv` and `-vvv` for added verbosity. Also consider running `--check` to do a dry-run as you are developing.

*TASK 1.* On your control node, change to the directory; /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/basic_playbook/resources (please note you will need to specify the correct user under the home directory)

To change directories, type; +
*$ cd /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/ansible_engine/basic_playbook/resources*

Verify the index.html.j2 and nginx.conf.j2 files are present by typing; *ls*

= *Lab #5.* Roles +
Your assignment is simple: refactor the Ansible playbook you've been developing into a role called "nginx-simple".

This assignment should result in a drop in replacement that is portable and more modular. It does not add any new tasks or functionality.

1. Initialize your role with `ansible-galaxy init` in a new subdirectory `roles/`.

2. Refactor your existing basic playbook and associated resources into your role.

3. Create a new playbook that uses the role still targeting the "web" group.

*TASK 1:* cd /home/student1/lightbulb/workshops/roles +
*TASK 2:* mkdir nginx-role +
*TASK 3:* cd nginx-role +
*TASK 4:* mkdir roles +
*TASK 5:* cd roles +
*TASK 6:* Type; ansible-galaxy init nginx-simple +
*TASK 7:* cd nginx-simple +
*TASK 8:* Type ls and verify your directory structure;

....
$ ls
defaults  
files  
handlers  
meta  
README.md  
tasks  
templates  
tests  
vars
....


*TASK 9:* Edit the main.yml files, index.html.j2, nginx.conf.j2 and remove.yml file accordingly (tree structure supplied below for your reference);
