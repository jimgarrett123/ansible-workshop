= *Lab #4. Basic_Playbook*

Create an Ansible playbook that will assure nginx is present, configured and running on all hosts in the "web" group:

....
1. Has variables for `nginx_test_message` and `nginx_keepalive_timeout`.
2. Assures that the following yum packages are present on the each web host:
    * nginx
    * python-pip
    * python-devel
    * gcc
3. Assure that the uwsgi pip package is present on each host.
4. Generate a host-specific home page with the value of `nginx_test_message` for each host using the provided `index.html.j2` template.
5. Generate a configuration with the value of `nginx_keepalive_timeout` for each host using the provided `nginx.conf.j2` template.
6. Assure that nginx is running on each host.
7. The playbook should restart nginx if the homepage or configuration file is altered.
....

While developing the playbook use the `--syntax-check` to check your work and debug problems.

Run your playbook in verbose mode using the `-v` switch to get more information on what Ansible is doing.

Try `-vv` and `-vvv` for added verbosity. Also consider running `--check` to do a dry-run as you are developing.

==== *+++<u>TASK 1.</u>+++*
On your control node, change to the directory */home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/ansible_engine/basic_playbook/resources* (please note you will need to specify the correct user under the home directory)

To change directories, type; +
*$ cd /home/studentnn/lightbulb/workshops/ansible_engine/basic_playbook/resources*

Verify the index.html.j2 and nginx.conf.j2 files are present by typing; *ls*


==== *+++<u>TASK 2.</u>+++*
On your control node open an editor (such as vi or nano) and create the following ansible playbook (be sure to start with the 3 dashes in the first line);
....
---
- name: install and start nginx with wsgi
  hosts: web
  become: yes
  vars:
    nginx_packages:
      - nginx
      - python-pip
      - python-devel
      - gcc

    nginx_keepalive_timeout: 115
    nginx_webserver_port: 80
  tasks:
    - name: nginx packages are present
      yum:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: present
      with_items: "{{ nginx_packages }}"
      notify: restart-nginx-service
    - name: uwsgi package is present
      pip:
        name: uwsgi

        dest: /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
        backup: yes
      notify: restart-nginx-service
    - name: latest index.html is present
      template:
        src: index.html.j2
        dest: /usr/share/nginx/html/index.html
    - name: nginx service is started and enabled
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: started
        enabled: yes
    # smoke test that nginx came up and is serving home page
    - name: proper response from localhost can be received
      uri:
        url: http://localhost/
        return_content: yes
      register: response
      until: 'nginx_test_message in response.content'
      retries: 10
      delay: 1
  handlers:
    - name: restart-nginx-service
      service:
        name: nginx
        state: restarted
....
Save the file as "basic_playbook.yml".


==== *+++<u>TASK 3.</u>+++*
Verify the syntax of the ansible playbook you just created by typing; +
*$ ansible-playbook basic_playbook.yml --syntax-check*

....
Example Output:
$ ansible-playbook basic_playbook.yml --syntax-check
playbook: basic_playbook.yml
....

Then run the playbook by typing: +
*$ ansible-playbook basic_playbook.yml*

....
Example Output:
$ ansible-playbook basic_playbook.yml

Verify nginx has been installed by testing one of your nodes. Open a browser on your laptop and point to the public IP address of one of your nodes (not the control node). +
i.e. http://34.229.6.4

If successful, you should see a web page with the Ansible logo but now with the text: *"This is a Test Message"*


==== *+++<u>TASK 4.</u>+++*
Extra Credit

Create, run and verify a seperate playbook that stops and removes nginx along with its configuration file and home page.

....
Playbook Solution:

    - name: nginx service is stopped
